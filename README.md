## CryptoClustering

Assignment # 19


# Project Description

This assignment looks at predicting clusters in crypto currency, that are affected by 24 hour and 7 day pricing. Using Python
we look at the data, plotting it (hvplot lines, scatter plots, elbow curves)

Scaling the data, finding the best data value for k using the original data. Use k-means to cluster the data and find the best value for k.
Then optimize clusters with PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

After calculating elbow curve PCA and scatter plot PCA, composite both the elbow curves and scatter plots to visually analyze the data.
